# WorkspaceService Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The `WorkspaceService` class has been refactored from a monolithic 288-line class into a clean, modular architecture with distinct responsibilities.

## Architecture Changes

### Before
- Single `WorkspaceService` class handling:
  - Directory scanning
  - Caching with timeout management
  - Empty directory pruning
  - Background preloading
  - Image loading and processing

### After
The functionality has been split into 5 focused classes:

1. **WorkspaceService** (~85 lines)
   - Acts as the main orchestrator
   - Delegates to specialized services
   - Maintains the same public API

2. **DirectoryCacheManager** (~55 lines)
   - Manages the file tree cache
   - Handles cache timeout and expiration
   - Provides cache invalidation features

3. **DirectoryScanner** (~115 lines)
   - Scans directories with depth control
   - Handles file system operations
   - Filters hidden directories and non-image files
   - Prunes empty directories
   - Sorts directory contents

4. **DirectoryPreloader** (~50 lines)
   - Manages background preloading queue
   - Schedules asynchronous directory loading
   - Prevents duplicate preload operations

5. **ImageLoader** (~75 lines)
   - Validates image files
   - Calculates optimal downsample factors
   - Converts images to base64 format

## Benefits

### Single Responsibility Principle
Each class now has a single, well-defined purpose, making the code easier to understand and maintain.

### Testability
- Each component can be tested in isolation
- Mocking dependencies is straightforward
- Test coverage is more comprehensive

### Extensibility
- New features can be added to specific components without affecting others
- Different caching strategies can be implemented by replacing `DirectoryCacheManager`
- Alternative scanning algorithms can be implemented in `DirectoryScanner`

### Maintainability
- Bugs are easier to locate and fix
- Code changes have limited scope
- Each class is small enough to understand at a glance

## API Compatibility
The public API of `WorkspaceService` remains unchanged:
- `loadDirectory(path, options)`
- `clearCache(path?)`
- `loadImageAsBase64(path, options)`

This ensures that existing code using `WorkspaceService` continues to work without modifications.

## Test Coverage
- Original `WorkspaceService` tests: 26 tests, all passing
- New `DirectoryCacheManager` tests: 10 tests, all passing
- Total test coverage maintained with improved modularity
